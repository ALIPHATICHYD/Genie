## Description

This is a simple web app that uses the Google Gemini API to generate text from text input and text from images. Initially built for testing the gpt-4-vision model,  on the announcement of the Gemini API, the code was quickly adapted to use the Gemini API.  This app was used for internal testing of the Gemini API for the company I work for, so it was not built for public use and is not maintained. The problem with the Gemini API is that as of the Date of writing <strong> it is not possible to use the API in the UK </strong> and with a big help from my sister who lives in India, I was able to test the API.
